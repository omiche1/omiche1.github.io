											<h3>Guide to Cosplay Comfort</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I made a video to walk you through some of the process of picking a cosplay and making it comfortable. I focsed on both physical and emotional comfort, but I fully believe they are inseperable. If you feel physically comfortable it only makes sense that you'll be a bit more emotionally comforatbel, and vice versa. Again, these are just my opinions and experiences, but feel free to comment!</p>

											<h3>Voices of the Community</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I interviewed three people in the cosplay community and recorded it for your listening pleasure! Dan is a 25 year old Filipina guy who prefers precise props and acting as a character, but struggles with his appearance. Leila is an 8 year old girl trying to break into the community, but limited to Halloween and by age. She prefers comfort over exactness and admits that she will laugha t silly costumes, though never to be mean. And Stefan is a 30 year old white man who has long been into conventions and a fan of cosplays. He refraines due to personal comfort and slight stage fright, but firmly preaches respect of personal space for all.</p>

											<h2>Who are you to talk?</h2>
											<p>A bit about me and why I know what I"m saying.</p>
										</header>
										<p>My name is Miki, I'm a student at Virginia Tech, and I've been obsessed with costuming since childhood. While I didn't begin cosplaying at conventions until I was 18, Ive always loved dressing as characters from my favorite stories, shows, movies, etc. I struggled for a long time with my confidence, I never felt comfortable wearing costumes in public, even if it was a convention. Part of this was the terrible teasing from my brothers, but a lot was just that I've never fit society's idea of beauty. Now I embrace my differences, but it wasn't always so easy.
										</p>
											<p>When I finally got th nerve to cosplay in public I made a LOT of mistakes. First off, I bought a costume that didn't fit very well, so Iwas physically miserable. I didn't take the time to consider what I'd be doing in costume, and how it would effect me. I never thought people would want to take my picture, and for some reason I thought being in character would pretect me from negative words. While my first experience wasn't full of insults, I wasn't happy, and I did get a few comments on how I messed up. I understand now that these people didn't mean anything by it, but they still weren't being very nice. It took me two years before I could get back into it. </p>
											<p> I took to researching cosplay in my spare time. Not just how to do it, cheats, and guides, but how people felt while doing this. I didn't find tons of information on this aspect, but what I did find was in blog posts and forums where cosplayers talked about their experiences and feelings. I noticed that a lot of the negative experiences people has were due to body shaming, of race, gender, size, and even modesty. I was pissed. So I decided to make a difference by cosplaying happily in ways that were comfortable to me. </p>
											<p> Now I make sure to talk to other cosplays with patient kindness, compliments, and gentle interest. I make sure that when I'm in costume I feel comfortable, physically and emotionally, and that I go into a convention with the understadning that I'm not perfect, and there may be some one prettier than me, skinnier, or even just better at making the costume or portraying the character. Now I want to share what I've learned, I want to help end the self-critical behaviors and external body shaming. So lend me a hand. </p>

												<h2>What's Cos-positivty?</h2>
												<p>What the heck am I doing and why</p>
											</header>
										<p>
											If you've noticed, over the past few years there have been a lot of outcries about body shaming. Many people, especially women, are comitted to ending the false perceptions of people thiking they have to be unhealty to be beautiful. We've seen companies like Aerie use real people instead of models to advertise thier clothes, even swim suits! And Dove started a whole movement aimed toward young girls, encouraging them to love themselves, no matter their size, shape, race, or age. Even actresses like Jenifer Lawrence are speaking out about how everyone's body is different, and that it's ok.

										</p>
										<p>
											I want to take this a step further; I want to adress body shaming in a community where people aren't even aware it's happening: Cosplay. As the cosplay community grows larger more cultural standards are placed on a formerly lax environment. Where nerds and geeks and fans used to be able to gather and simply enjoy themselves and their favorite things, we now have the preasure to be perfect. Much of the animostisy in the cosplay community comes from individuals who direct it at themselves, basically being overly critical. But we also have people who are unkind and presumtuous, who judge out loud and make people feel uncomfortable by invading personal space and objectifying people. Luckily, it hasn't yet permeated our community completely, I'm just trying to stop it before it explodes.

												<h3>Some Examples of What's Happening</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Earlier I talked about how I had few negative experiences when cosplaying, well now I'm going to give you the details.
											</p>
											<p>
												My very first experience with cosplay in public, as in, not a party, was as Harley Quinn. I ware the original jumpsuit, skin tight, and the hood, the cuffs, all of it. the only piece I was missing were the shoes. I chose to wear chucks, converses, one red and one black. I thought this was very clever, and actually compliments from a fw girls who wished they'd done the same instead of heels. But what stuck with me the most was my discomfort. The outfit I wore was skin tight. There was no stetch, and no hidin anything. I wasn't, and still am not, the porportions of Harley Quinn, and it was obvious. I took to hiding myself and hunching, ignoring people who called out to me out of fear. It didn't help matters that the costume didn't breath and the hood was as restricting as the jumpsuit. These physical discomforts only added to my emotional distress, and I left the convention early to change clothes. While this wasn't directly caused by others, I do think society influenced me a bit, this is part of the body shaming I want to combat. I didn't take into account my personal comfort levels, and I was miserable. I also know I was not attractive because the jumpsuit wasn't styled for my body type, nor did it fit correctly. I give some tips in my viedo to the left about handling the self-criticism, and being comfortable.
											</p>
											<p> On another occasion, as Poison Ivy, I was shamed verbally by another person. My Poison Ivy costume consists of a leotard and corset with leaves, and well as dance leggings and a wig. The two occasions that stand out the most to me actually happened in the same day, and if it weren't for my firends and their support I would have gone again. The first interaction was, unfortunately, typical for conventins. Because I was wearing a rather bare costume a man approached me and saw fit to not only hit on me, but make overt sexual advances, to put it nicely. To be blunt, he called me a hot piece of ass and then tried to take my pictures while saying I was one of the few worth while Ivys...Then he belittled an overweight woman he had seen earlier portraying the same character. I was in shock, and honestly didn't know what to do, but my friends noticed my discomfort and removed me. Wearing a revealing costume does not mean you can talk to a person like that, ever. The second instance was a girl who told me I was too fat to be wearing such tight and minimal costume, she said it was people like me that made the rest of society think all cosplayers were fat, lazy, weirdos. Again, I was in shock. What had happened to the people who would compliment someone just for trying and showing up? What happened to the comradery over fandoms? All I could think was that the community was starting to care more about appearances than fandoms.

												<h3>What Can You Take Away?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I can't force you to change how you think about someone, and I can't force you to learn anything from what I"m saying. All I can do is spread this information and hope that it gets through to people. If you want to judge someone, fine, do it in your head. Don't ruin someone's day or self-perceptin by being mean. Try to remember why we dress up, why we go to conventions: because we want to have fun. We want to be surounded by people who care about the things we enjoy and spend days revelling in our favorite pasttimes. So go olet ohers enjoythemsleves as you do the same. Also, please don't think that there are only mean people at conventions. The vast majority of cosplayers are kind and respectful, but it is declining. And please don't let my bad experiences stop you from going out and cosplaying, there are many more times that it's worth it.

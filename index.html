											<h2>Who are you to talk?</h2>
											<p>A bit about me and why I know what I'm saying.</p>
										</header>
										<p id="para1">My name is Miki, I'm a student at Virginia Tech and I've been obsessed with costuming since childhood. While I didn't begin cosplaying at conventions until I was 18, I've always loved dressing as characters from my favorite stories, shows, movies, etc. I struggled for a long time with my self-confidence and never felt comfortable wearing costumes in public. Not even at conventions. Part of this was the terrible teasing from my brothers, but a lot was because I've never fit society's idea of beauty. Now I embrace my differences, but it took some doing.
										</p>
											<p id="para2">When I finally got the nerve to cosplay in public I made a LOT of mistakes. First off, I bought a costume that didn't fit very well, so I was physically miserable. I didn't take the time to consider what I'd be doing in costume and how it would effect me. I also never thought people would want to take my picture. And for some reason I thought being in character would protect me from negative words. While my first experience wasn't full of insults, I wasn't happy. I actuall did get a few comments from strangers on how I messed up. I understand now that these people didn't mean anything by it, but they still weren't being very nice. It took me two years before I could get back into it.   </p>
											<p id="para3"> I took to researching cosplay in my spare time. Not just how to do it, cheats, and guides, but how people felt while doing this. I noticed that a lot of the negative experiences people had were due to body shaming; of race, gender, size, and even modesty. I was pissed. So I decided to do something about it. I do my best to cosplay happily in ways that are comfortable to me, and make sure I treat everyone with respect and kindness. </p>
											<p id="para4"> When I talk to toher cosplayers I make sure to patient, kind, and open to their opinions. I make sure that when I'm in costume I feel comfortable, physically and emotionally. I go into a convention with the understanding that I'm not perfect and there may be someone prettier than me, skinnier, or even just better at making the costume or portraying the character. By doing this I have made my time cosplaying far more fun than before, and I genuinely like how I look. Now I want to share what I've learned, I want to help end the self-critical behaviors and external body shaming. . </p>

												<h2>What's Cos-positivty?</h2>
												<p>What the heck am I doing and why</p>
											</header>
										<p id="para5">
										If you've noticed, over the past few years there have been a lot of outcries about body shaming. Many people, especially women, are committed to ending the false perceptions of people thinking they have to be unhealthy to be beautiful. We've seen companies like Aerie use real people instead of models to advertise their clothes, even swim suits! And Dove started a whole movement aimed toward young girls, encouraging them to love themselves, no matter their size, shape, race, or age. Even actresses like Jennifer Lawrence are speaking out about how everyone's body is different, and that it's ok.
										</p>
										<p id="para6">
											I want to take this a step further. I want to address body shaming in a community where people aren't even aware it's happening: Cosplay. As the cosplay community grows larger more cultural standards are placed on a formerly lax environment. Where nerds and geeks and fans used to be able to gather and simply enjoy themselves and their favorite things, we now have the pressure to be perfect. Much of the animosity in the cosplay community comes from individuals who direct it at themselves, typically being overly critical. But we also have people who are unkind and presumptuous, who judge out loud and make people feel uncomfortable by invading personal space and objectifying them. Luckily, it hasn't yet permeated our community completely, so I can try to stop it.

												<h3>Some Examples of What's Happening</h3>
											</header>
											<p id="para7">
												Earlier I talked about how I had few negative experiences when cosplaying, well now I'm going to give you the details.
											My very first experience with cosplay in public, as in, not a party, was as Harley Quinn. I wore the original jumpsuit, which was skin tight, the hood, the cuffs, all of it. the only piece I was missing were the shoes. I chose to wear chucks, one red and one black. I actually got compliments from a fw girls who wished they'd done the same instead of wearing heels. But what stuck with me the most was my discomfort. The outfit I wore was skin tight. There was no stretch, and no hiding anything. I wasn't, and still am not, the proportions of Harley Quinn, and it was obvious. I took to hiding myself by hunching and ignoring people who called out to me. The physical discomforts only added to my emotional distress, and I left the convention early to change. While this wasn't directly caused by others, I do think society influenced me a bit, this is part of the body shaming I want to combat. I didn't take into account my personal comfort levels, and I was miserable. I also know I was not attractive because the jumpsuit wasn't styled for my body type, nor did it fit correctly. I give some tips in my video to the left about handling the self-criticism, and being comfortable.
											</p>
											<p id="para8"> On another occasion, as Poison Ivy, I was shamed verbally by other people. My Poison Ivy costume consists of a leotard and corset with leaves, and well as dance leggings and a wig. The two occasions that stand out the most actually happened in the same day. If it weren't for my friends and their support I would have gone again. The first interaction was a man who approached me and saw fit to not only hit on me, but make overt sexual advances. To be blunt, he called me a hot piece of ass and then tried to take my pictures, at the same time saying I was one of the few worth while Ivy’s...Then he belittled an overweight woman he had seen earlier portraying the same character. I was in shock, and honestly didn't know what to do, but my friends noticed my discomfort and removed me. Wearing a revealing costume does not mean you can talk to a person like that, ever. The second instance was a girl who told me I was too fat to be wearing such a tight and minimal costume, she said it was people like me that made the rest of society think all cosplayers were fat, lazy, weirdos. Again, I was in shock. What had happened to the people who would compliment someone just for trying and showing up? What happened to the comradery over fandoms? All I could think was that the community was starting to care more about appearances than fandoms.

												<h3>What Can You Take Away?</h3>
											</header>
											<p id="para9">
												I can't force you to change how you think about someone, and I can't force you to learn anything from what I’m saying. All I can do is spread this information and hope that it gets through to people. If you want to judge someone, fine, do it in your head. Don't ruin someone's day or self-perception by being mean. Try to remember why we dress up, why we go to conventions: because we want to have fun. We want to be surrounded by people who care about the things we enjoy and spend days revelling in our favorite pastimes. So let others enjoy themselves as you do the same. Also, please don't think that there are only mean people at conventions. The vast majority of cosplayers are kind and respectful, but it is declining. Don't let my bad experiences stop you from going out and cosplaying, there are many more times that it's worth it.
